Got a school project to make a 2D bomberman game by myself in Unity. This is the first time I'm making a game by myself from "scratch". Of course I used free Unity asset store assets, watched a lot of tutorials and did a lot of research. I made a couple of sprites in piskel website and animated them in Unity though.

I wanted to make the game local multiplayer (for now) to try it out with friends. 

I used Unity Collab previously to version control and recently added the project to GitHub to test it out.
